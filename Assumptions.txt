-- If from an Auction, any bidder has invalid input - start bid, max bid, increment as 0 or negative then I throw an 
exception to let Client know they entered wrong input.
 
 -- The requirement for end result is the Winner of each auction hence to optimize run time, max possible bids and 
 minimum winning amount per bidder is calculated and returned. The auto increment information will be transient 
 but not stored as it is not asked.

-- Assessment requirements states US Dollar amount, so implementing only for USD.
